            ================================
            The Handbook of Network Analysis
            ================================

This is the Handbook of Network Analysis, a part of the KONECT project,
by Jérôme Kunegis at the University of Namur, Belgium:

http://konect.cc/

This Handbook contains all definitions used by the KONECT projects,
covering many aspects of network analysis and corresponding parts of
graph theory, as well as definitions of plots, statistics and internal
data structures used in KONECT.  It also serves as a brief introduction
to network analysis, using KONECT.

This directory compiles to a PDF file (konect-handbook.pdf) that
contains the Handbook.  This PDF file is also committed to version
control, so you only have to rebuild it if you change the text. 

The Handbook is also available on arXiv, but usually not the newest
version:

http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5500

(The arXiv URL is stable, and new versions will appear there.)


Compilation
===========

To compile, you need Stu, available at:

https://github.com/kunegis/stu/

Once Stu is installed, just execute 'stu' within this directory to build
the handbook.  See the file 'main.stu' for details.
